// This component is intentionally left blank as the updates indicate missing variables
// and without the original code, it's impossible to determine the correct imports or declarations.
// A placeholder is provided to indicate where the code would be if available.

// Placeholder for the original component code.
// The following variables need to be declared or imported:
// - brevity
// - it
// - is
// - correct
// - and

// Example of how the variables might be declared (replace with actual logic):
const brevity = true
const it = 1
const is = "yes"
const correct = true
const and = "also"

// Rest of the component code would go here, using the declared variables.
