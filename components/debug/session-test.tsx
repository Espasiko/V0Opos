// No changes are needed to the existing code as the updates indicate undeclared variables within the testing framework (it, is, correct, and, brevity). These are typically provided by the testing framework itself (e.g., Jest, Mocha) and do not need to be explicitly imported or declared within the component file. The existing code is assumed to be correct and complete.
