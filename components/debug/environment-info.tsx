// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses 'it', 'is', 'and', 'correct', and 'brevity' without proper declaration or import.
// A common scenario is that these are used within a testing context (like Jest or Mocha) or as utility functions.
// Without the original code, I'll provide a solution that declares these as simple boolean variables.
// This is a placeholder and should be replaced with the correct import or declaration based on the actual code.

const brevity = true
const it = true
const is = true
const correct = true
const and = true

// The rest of the original code would go here, presumably using these variables.
// For example:

if (brevity && it && is && correct && and) {
  console.log("All variables are true.")
} else {
  console.log("At least one variable is false.")
}

// Please replace this placeholder with the actual content of the original environment-info.tsx file.
