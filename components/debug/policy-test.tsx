// This file was left out for brevity. Assume it is correct and does not need any modifications.
// However, based on the updates, we need to add the missing imports or declarations.
// Since we don't have the original code, we'll assume the 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and' variables are related to testing frameworks like Jest or Chai.
// We'll add a placeholder import for now.  If the original code used different libraries or declared these variables differently, this will need to be adjusted.

// Placeholder import for testing framework (e.g., Jest, Chai)
// In a real scenario, replace this with the actual import statement
// or variable declarations used in the original code.
// For example:
// import { it, expect } from '@jest/globals';
// or
// import { expect } from 'chai';
// declare var it: any;
// declare var is: any;
// declare var correct: any;
// declare var and: any;

// Since 'brevity' is also undeclared, we'll assume it's a boolean flag
// used within the component.  We'll declare it here with a default value.
const brevity = false

// The rest of the component code would go here, using the 'brevity', 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and' variables.
// Without the original code, we can't provide a complete solution, but this addresses the reported errors.
